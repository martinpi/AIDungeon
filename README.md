# Not AI Dungeon (NAID)

This is my personal clone of AI Dungeon with the purpose of getting it out of the dungeon and into more interesting realms of fantasy that are not as high.

Read more about AIDungeon2 and how it was built [here](https://pcc.cs.byu.edu/2019/11/21/ai-dungeon-2-creating-infinitely-generated-text-adventures-with-deep-learning-language-models/).

All of the code is in Python 3. Only small changes made so far.

Be sure to check out the original project.

Just like AI Dungeon I have not included the model in this build. I'm using their scrapper and a colab environment to fine tune. This whole repository is basically not the interesting part of my clone (yet).
